Description: Adjusts an ns() basis matrix so that all terms are
    zero when x takes the specified centre value. When used in a
    model formula, this ensures that the regression intercept can
    be interpreted with respect to centred x-value, rather than
    with respect to the x-value of the first boundary knot.
