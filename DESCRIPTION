Title: Natural Cubic SPLines with Interpretable INTercepts

Description: Adjusts an ns() basis matrix so that all terms are
    zero when x = centre. When used in a model formula, this
    ensures that the regression intercept can be interpreted as
    with respect to centre, rather than with respect to the
    x-value of the first boundary knot.
